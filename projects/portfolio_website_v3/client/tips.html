        <h2>Refuse</h2>
        <p>Sometimes just say "no" to a gift or free things, especially if you don't need them. You can really  reduce a lot of things in your house by just simply not bringing them into your house. When you go grocery shopping use your own bag. Reusable items are better than accepting plastic or paper bags. </p>
