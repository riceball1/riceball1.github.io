Hello World!

This site is my personal site where I provide examples of some of my programming projects, also focused on things I'm interested in: language, travel, food, and minimalism. 

This site was build using `gh-pages` as well as `react`. 

Tutorial on building the site found here [link](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)

Command to run new build each time `npm run deploy`

Looking forward to updating this page more with modern frontend technologies.

Best,
Dana
