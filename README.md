<h4>Introduction</h4>
This website hosted by github. I began developing this website on April 2016, and so far I have hosted several projects on github. I am continously expanding my knowledge in several areas of web development, including using the latest improvements on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hopefully more updates to this page in the future.
