## Introduction
This website hosted by github. I began developing this website on April 2016, and so far I have hosted several projects on github. I am continously expanding my knowledge in several areas of web development, including using the latest improvements on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hopefully more updates to this page in the future.

## Technologies:
- Gulp: to manage tasks such as turning less files into css files [I have mind globally installed using ```npm install gulp-cli -g```]
