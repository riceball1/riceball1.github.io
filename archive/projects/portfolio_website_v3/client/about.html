    <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hi, this website is an assignment for Coursera Course 5 - Week 2 on extending a portfolio website. The theme of my website is on Minimalism, a concept about reducing waste in our lives. My website follows the assignment's instructions listed below:</p>
      <ul class="checkmark">
        <li>Clear navigation allowing the user to move between pages and locate relevant information</li>
        <li>Consistent style across the pages through the use of CSS
        </li>
        <li>Responsive layout where the layout changes depending on the size of the browser window</li>
        <li>Use of Bootstrap</li>
        <li>Clearly stated purpose for each page</li>
        <li>Contain no less than 10 posts in addition to any static content. It should also contain at least three video links and 6 still images</li>

        <h2>What is Minimalism?</h2>
        <p>Minimalism is derived from zen philosophy. A definition from the website <a href="http://www.becomingminimalist.com/what-is-minimalism/">becomingminimalist.com</a> suggests:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Minimalism is intentionality</li>
            <li>Minimalism is freedom from the passion to possess.</li>
            <li>Minimalism is freedom from modern mania.</li>
            <li>Minimalism is freedom from duplicity.</li>
            <li>Minimalism is counter-cultural.</li>
            <li>Minimalism is not external, but internal.</li>
            <li>Minimalism is completely achievable.</li>
          </ul>
